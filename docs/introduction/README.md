# Introduction

The Object-Constraint-Language is used to add additional constraints to a given modelling language.
Since there do exist implementations in Java (e.g. Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF)) but not JavaScript, this is a basic OCL implementation in JavaScript.

This library does not claim to be fully compliant to the given OMG OCL definition and might have slight differences.
