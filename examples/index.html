        <h1>OCL.js &ndash; A simple implementation of Object Constraint Language</h1>
        <p>
            The OCL ist a language used in Meta-Modelling to add additional constraints to the meta model which can't be
            expressed by the given meta modelling language. Since there do exist implementations in Java
            (e.g. Eclipse Modelling Framework EMF), this is a basic OCL implementation in JavaScript.

                        Given is a class Person having a pointer to its parent which is as well type of Person but having
                        the constraint not to be the self instance as the child Person. Which basically means: A person
                        can not be the parent of itself.
